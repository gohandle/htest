# htest
Provides expressive assertion of http handlers that return HTML


## Backlog
- [ ] COULD add a build in way to validate html using the official html validator. Or might be worthy of 
      a separate package so it can also run on our css and js. https://github.com/validator/validator
- [ ] COULD allow for session matching with a build in type, to allow for users to test what is set
      in a session
- [ ] COULD support fuzzing of templates
